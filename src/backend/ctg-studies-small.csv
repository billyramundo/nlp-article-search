NCT06558474,Optimization of Percutaenous Coronary Intervention With Liberal Use of Post-dilatation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06558474,OPTIMIZE-PCI,RECRUITING,"To achieve optimal long-term clinical results after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), adequate deployment of stents is essential. Thorough expansion of the stent and full apposition of stent struts against the vessel wall are determining factors for preventing stent thrombosis and restenosis for bare-metal as well as drug-eluting stents (DES). Standard coronary angiography is limited in assessing accurate vessel size and characterizing tissues and calcium load. Therefore, stent underexpansion frequently occurs after stent deployment.

Post-dilation is often performed to achieve optimal stent expansion and reduce stent malapposition of stent struts, aiming to reduce stent thrombosis and restenosis both short term as long term. However, there are limited studies that have explored the effect of post-dilatation for stent optimization on clinical outcomes. As a result of the restricted evidence, there is no consensus whether post-dilatation should be used routinely in clinical practice and the extent to which post-dilatation is being utilized remains unclear.

We therefore designed the OPTIMIZE PCI, a national registry-based quality improvement project to implement a liberal post-dilatation strategy in multiple PCI centers in the Netherlands.

Continuous medical research has dramatically improved the outcomes for patients with RA. Traditional therapeutic approaches have relied on glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate, sulfasalazine or leflunomide. Glucocorticoids and NSAIDs interfere with the inflammatory cascades while DMARDs impede both the inflammatory and the destructive processes of RA.

These drugs, although efficient, are not specifically directed against inflammatory cells or cytokines and are associated with significant toxicity. The development of biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs), has been an important step forward. Their ability to neutralize specific cytokines or target distinct immune cells filled a gap in existing treatment options for RA. \[3\]. However, some patients still have only partial or no response to bDMARDs.

As seen in the data in the literature and in daily practice, hemodynamic parameters (such as heart rate, blood pressure) are used for pain monitoring of the patient under general anesthesia, and these parameters may change depending on many other factors.Although some devices that aim to provide pain monitoring by evaluating the effects of pain on the sympathetic system are available on the market, their usage areas have remained limited since their reliability has not been fully demonstrated. Nociception level index (NoL) monitoring provides effective monitoring as it evaluates each patient separately using different parameters (heart rate, heart rate variability, photo-plethysmographic waveform amplitude, skin conductance level, number of skin conductance fluctuations and their time derivatives).Although there are studies indicating that it can be used for operations under general anesthesia, it has not yet been used routinely.Ledowski et al. and Renoud-Roy et al. (8) have shown that NoL index monitoring under general anesthesia is successful in detecting painful stimuli.In a study conducted by Espitalier et al. in 2021 in patients undergoing gynecological surgery, NoL index monitoring reduced intraoperative opioid consumption by 22% without affecting postoperative pain scores.While planning this study, we aimed to use NoL monitoring in hip surgery, where postoperative pain management is quite challenging and important, as it provides objective and personalized pain management in patients under general anesthesia.In this study, we aimed to see the effectiveness of opioid consumption and Peng block by using the NoL index and hemodynamic parameters.When other studies in the literature are examined, the effects of regional techniques have been compared only in the postoperative period.Its effects in the intraoperative period have not been evaluated on a patient basis, and the opioid infusion rate has been adjusted with hemodynamic findings, which are affected by many parameters such as bleeding and drug use.In this study, we aim to compare the effects of intraoperative pain monitoring and personalized analgesia treatment and the regional technique both in the intraoperative period and in the postoperative period.",NO,Post Operative Pain|Opioid Use,PROCEDURE: Those whose opioids were adjusted according to hemodynamic parameters|PROCEDURE: Those whose opioids were adjusted according to NOL monitoring,"Remifentanil consumption, Total amount of remifentanil used during the surgery (mg), Intraoperative|NRS Scores, Numeric Rating Scale scores, between 0-10 (0= no pain, 10=worst pain imaginable), Postoperative 1st, 6th, 12th and 24th hours|Morphine consumption, Amount of morphine in the postoperative period (mg), Postoperative 1st, 6th, 12th and 24th hours","Rescue analgesic, The use of rescue analgesic, Postoperative 1st, 6th, 12th and 24th hours|Nausea and vomiting, If the patient had nausea or vomiting, it will be recorded., Postoperative 1st, 6th, 12th and 24th hours",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT"

NCT06558019,Exosome-based OCS Scores for Predicting Ovarian Cancer Recurrence,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06558019,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Ovarian cancer is the third most common malignant tumor in China's female reproductive system in terms of incidence rate and the first in terms of mortality. Surgery and systemic chemotherapy are the cornerstone of first-line treatment for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. The efficacy rate of first-line platinum combined with taxus chemotherapy is more than 80%, and more than half of them reach complete remission (CR). However, even if advanced patients reach CR, 50% -70% still relapse, with a median disease-free interval of 16 months. Most patients lack typical symptoms when they relapse. The sensitivity of CA125 in monitoring recurrence is poor (43-74%), which means that more than 25% of ovarian cancer patients cannot detect recurrence in a timely manner during follow-up. Therefore, more sensitive biomarkers are needed for monitoring ovarian cancer recurrence after treatment. More and more studies have explored the application value of extracellular vesicle technology in the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer, including auxiliary diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring, etc. China already has an approved exosome ovarian cancer diagnostic product by the National Medical Products Administration, namely the Ovarian Cancer Diagnostic Score (OCS) product based on exosome technology, which is also the world's first exosome technology diagnostic kit for ovarian cancer. Clinical trial data shows that OCS products have demonstrated excellent performance in distinguishing between benign and malignant ovarian tumors. Under high specificity (90.2%), it has a higher sensitivity than serum CA125, reaching 95.5% (95% CI 92.7% -97.3%), and has a sensitivity of 89.7% in the diagnosis of stage I ovarian cancer. OCS exhibits better sensitivity than CA125, especially in early ovarian cancer, suggesting that OCS may be a better tool for monitoring recurrence in ovarian cancer patients.The main purpose of this study is to establish an OCS scoring ovarian cancer recurrence prediction and monitoring model based on exosome technology, providing an effective tool for clinical ovarian cancer recurrence prediction and monitoring. Secondly, we hope to explore the correlation between OCS score and tumor staging, chemotherapy sensitivity, PFS, OS indicators, etc., and determine the performance of recurrence prediction models in different subgroups, such as different pathological subtypes of ovarian cancer and different treatment methods.",NO,Ovarian Cancer,,"progression-free survival, Progression-free survival after diagnosis, 2 yeas|overall survival, Overall survival after diagnosis, 2 years",,,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT"

Although there are various modalities, in cases where medical and noninvasive methods are ineffective, diluted local anesthetic injections or diluted local anesthetic injections with steroids, and sometimes dry needling or botulinum toxin, are preferred. In recent years, imaging methods such as ultrasonography have been frequently used for trigger point injections. These injections may be repeated for several sessions depending on the patient's response. Pain, local anesthetic toxicity, bleeding, allergic reactions, pneumothorax, intramuscular hematoma, cerebrovascular events, spinal injury, vasovagal syncope and infections have been reported during injections. Therefore, during trigger point injections, vascular access should be established in the patient, the patient should be monitored, injections should be performed under sterile conditions, and an emergency kit should be kept ready in all cases .

Although TAVI is a safe and effective treatment for a faulty aortic heart valve, the new TAVI valve will not last forever. Because it is a 'tissue' valve (made from the lining of a cow or pig heart), the valve will fail after a period of time as the tissue degenerates.

When the TAVI valve fails, a viable treatment option is to perform a 'Redo TAVI' procedure, implanting a second TAVI valve inside the first failing valve.

Do fewer babies who receive prophylactic thin catheter surfactant under video laryngoscopy shortly after birth go on to be ventilated within 72 hours of birth?

Extremely premature babies who are receiving breathing support through a face mask will either:

* Receive surfactant through a thin catheter that is inserted into their windpipe (trachea) under video laryngoscopy at or after 5 minutes of life, have the catheter removed immediately, and return to face mask breathing support; or
